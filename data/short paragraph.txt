The chosen parameters worked best because they balanced fitting the data well without overfitting, especially important because we added noise. The C value helped control how much the model adjusts to the data's details, avoiding overfitting. The solver type was picked for its efficiency with our dataset's size and type. Essentially, these parameters helped the model learn the patterns without getting confused by the noise or details that don't matter.
